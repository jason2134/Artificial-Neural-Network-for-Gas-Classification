## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

My first Artificial Neural Network which is capable of multi-gas classification. This proeject is developed for self-learning purposes

This ANN can classify if the following gases are present with 91% accuracy:
- Hydrogren
- Formaldehyde
- Toluene
- Nitrogen Dioxide



## 🚀 How does it work <a name = "work"></a>:
- Check out the [notebook](https://github.com/jason2134/Artificial-Neural-Network-for-Gas-Classification/blob/main/PCA_ANN_Pytorch.ipynb) for the detailed coding

### 📥 **Components** 
 - Python
     - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
     - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
